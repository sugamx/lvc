    <h2>Welcome to Class</h2>
    <p>A live virtual class is an online learning environment where instructors and students interact in real-time. This setup closely mimics traditional classroom experiences but takes place over the internet. Here are some key features:
        Real-Time Interaction: Students and instructors engage through live video, audio, and chat, allowing for immediate feedback and dynamic discussions1.
        Interactive Tools: These classes often use tools like online whiteboards, breakout rooms for group activities, and instant messaging to enhance collaboration1.
        Flexibility and Accessibility: Students can join from anywhere, making it convenient and accessible. This is especially beneficial for those who need to balance other commitments2.
        Engaging Learning Experience: The live format helps maintain a structured learning environment, which can be more engaging and motivating compared to self-paced learning2.
        Live virtual classes combine the benefits of traditional classroom settings with the flexibility of online learning, making them a popular choice for many learners today..</p>
